# Tympan_Rev_C_Hardware
Repository for the board files for Tympan Rev C


These deisgn files were made with [KiCAD](http://kicad-pcb.org/) PCB capture software. The custom component files for parts used in this design are loced in the repo as well. Everything should render correctly in the Schematic and the PCB. If not, you may need to adjust the library paths. 

This work is based on work done by Creare and their team in Spring of 2017. Modifications have been made to their Rev A hardware design to overcome bugs and improve the design.
